Hello! Thank you for submitting an issue to our repository. **HOWEVER**, don't do it here. We don't monitor this repository, and all the files are autogenerated so any issues submitted here will be in vain.

Please submit your issue to the [azure-iot-sdk-c repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c), and add "Arduino PAL" in the issue title. 

Thanks!
